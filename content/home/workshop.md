Together with Aditya Nandy and Nick Yang, I have put together a workshop covering the basic ideas of machine learning, intended for graduate students in chemical sciences. To date, I have presented this workshop at MIT, Ben Gurion University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  
You can find a version the slides [here](https://github.com/jpjanet/ML-chem-workshop/blob/master/main.pdf). Check out the full [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jpjanet/ML-chem-workshop), which includes some neat interactive [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/jpjanet/ML-chem-workshop/tree/master/notebooks)!
