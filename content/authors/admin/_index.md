I am a graduate student in the chemical and computational engineering Ph.D. program at MIT,
advised by professors Heather Kulik and Youssef Marzouk. My research lies at the intersection of atomistic  simulation, machine learning and materials design. I use quantum chemical simulations to train machine learning models that can be used to discover new materials with targeted properties.
